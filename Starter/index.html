<!--the body text -->

<p>The innovative animation studio never fails to surprise with their fantastical films. Drawing from Miyazaki's childhood, traditional Japanese folklore and various novels these movies force you to reconsider what animation means. These meticulously hand drawn films blow me away each and every time. If you have yet to watch a Studio Ghibli film I would recommend starting with Howl's Moving Castle. It is a good introduction to the Studio's filmography. Below is a list of some of their most famous films.</p>

<p>These movies will make you <strong><em>laugh and cry</em></strong> at the same time. The beautiful animation leaves you speechless everytime. They are so utterly fantastical that even if you don't fully understand what is going on it still keeps you captivated. All of the films are filled with creatures that seem to have come from a dream. </p>
